House Price Prediction - ElasticNet Regression Approach 

Overview

This project leverages ElasticNet Regression to predict house prices by combining Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) regularization techniques. ElasticNet is particularly useful for handling multicollinearity and selecting the most relevant features while preventing overfitting. The workflow includes data preprocessing, where missing values are imputed, categorical variables are encoded, and feature scaling is applied. A detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted using visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps to extract key insights. The model is evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R² Score, and cross-validation to ensure robust performance.
